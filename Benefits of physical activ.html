<h1>Benefits of Physiacl Activity</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Though people often use physical activity and exercise interchangeably, the terms have different definitions.“Physical activity” refers to any body movement that burns 
calories, whether it’s for work or play, daily chores, or the daily commute.
<br> “Exercise,” a subcategory of physical activity, refers to -planned, structured, and repetitive- activities 
aimed at improving physical fitness and health. Exercise is a bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. 
Physical activity is number one most common health issue in the world. Staying physically active can help prevent or delay certain diseases, including some cancers, heart disease and diabetes, and also relieve depression and improve mood. 
<br>
A research Physical Activity Fundamental to Preventing Disease published by U.S. 
Department of Health & Human Services claims that virtually all individuals can benefit from 
regular physical activity, whether they participate in vigorous exercise or some type of moderate health-enhancing physical activity.

    <p>
        The benefits of physical exercise, especially aerobic exercise, have positive effects on brain function on multiple fronts, ranging from the molecular to behavioral level.
      <br>  According to a study done by the Department of Exercise Science at the University of Georgia, 
        even briefly exercising for 20 minutes facilitates information processing 
        <br>and memory functions.
    </p>
    <p>

        Exercise affects the brain on multiple fronts. It increases heart rate, which pumps more oxygen to the brain. It also aids the bodily release of a plethora of hormones, 
        all of which participate in aiding and providing a nourishing environment for the growth of brain cells.
    </p>
<p>
    Exercise stimulates the brain plasticity by stimulating growth of new connections between cells in a wide array of important cortical areas of the brain. Research from UCLA
     demonstrated that exercise increased growth factors in the brain—making it easier for the brain to grow new neuronal connections.
</p>

<p>
    Exercise can come down to improving cognitive skills, decreasing chances of dementia along with reducing damage and deterioration of the brain tissue. Scientist believe that
     by maintaining psychical fitness it keeps the blood flowing normally to brain tissue. When the blood flows normally to the brain tissue it reduces the risk of damage and 
     deterioration. Blood flow is very important when it comes to keeping the brain young and healthy. 
     There have also been studies that show that aerobic exercise stimulate the release of growth hormones, which continues to improve brain function. When getting to a certain age it is prone that one exercises regularly to keep the brain strong and well functioning, rather than deteriorating.
      It also reduces the chances of dementia as it keeps the find functioning and lessens the chances of deterioration.
</p>

<p>
    Some benefits of physical activity on brain health happen right after a session of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Benefits include improved thinking or cognition 
    for children 6 to 13 years of age and reduced short-term feelings of anxiety for adults. Regular physical activity can help keep your thinking, learning, and judgment skills sharp as you age. 
    It can also reduce your risk of depression and anxiety and help you sleep better

<b id="titre3"> Weight management</b>
<p> 
    Both diet and physical activity play a critical role in maintaining a healthy body weight, losing excess body weight, or maintaining successful weight loss.
    Physical activity helps control weight by using excess calories that would otherwise be stored as fat. Most foods we eat contain calories, and everything we do uses calories, including sleeping, 
    breathing, and digesting food. Balancing the calories we eat with the calories we use through physical activity will help us reach and maintain a healthy weight.

    The most common health risks include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes type 2 and some cancers.
Obesity is a complex disease that affects whole body metabolism and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D).
 Physical exercise results in numerous health benefits and is an important tool to combat obesity and its co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease. Exercise prevents 
 both the onset and development of cardiovascular disease and is an important therapeutic tool to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. 
 Some benefits of exercise include enhanced mitochondrial function, restoration and improvement of vasculature, and the release of myokines from skeletal muscle that preserve or augment cardiovascular function. In this review we will discuss the mechanisms through which exercise promotes cardiovascular health.
  Regular physical exercise has several beneficial effects on overall health.
   While decreasing body mass and adiposity are not the primary outcomes of exercise, exercise can mediate several diseases that 
   accompany obesity including T2D and CVD. Several recent studies have shown that sustained physical activity is associated with decreased markers of inflammation, improved metabolic health, decreased risk of heart failure, and improved overall survival.
   <br> There are several risk factors leading to the development and progression of CVD, but one of the most prominent is a sedentary lifestyle. A sedentary lifestyle can be characterized by both obesity and consistently low levels of physical activity. Thus, lifestyle interventions that aim to increase physical activity and decrease ob
esity are attractive therapeutic methods to combat most non-congenital types of CVD.

<b id="titre5"> Cardiovascular Risk Factors</b>
<p>
    Regular physical exercise is associated with numerous health benefits to reduce the progression and development of obesity, T2D, and CVD. 
    <br> Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that lifestyle interventions including moderate exercise and a healthy diet improve cardiovascular health in at-risk populations. 
    Individuals with metabolic syndrome who participated in a 4 month program of either a diet (caloric restriction) or exercise intervention had reduced adiposity, decreased systolic, diastolic and mean 
    arterial blood pressure, and lower total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lipid profiles compared to the control group. Both the diet and exercise intervention
    improve these cardiovascular outcomes to a similar extent.
</p>
<p>
    Several previous studies have investigated the effects of diet and exercise, independently or in combination, on metabolic and cardiovascular health and have determined 
    that diet, exercise, or a combination of diet and exercise induces weight loss, decreases visceral adiposity, lowers plasma triglycerides, plasma glucose, HDL levels, and blood pressure, and improves VO2max. 
    Importantly, several of these beneficial effects of exercise are evident independent of weight loss. Studies have shown that exercise can improve metabolic and cardiovascular health independent of changes in body weight, including improved glucose homeostasis, endothelial function, blood pressure, and HDL levels. These data indicate exercise, independent of changes in body mass, results in significant improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic health.
     Although a detailed analysis of the vast impact of diet on cardiometabolic health is outside the scope of this review, the importance of diet and exercise in tandem should not be ignored, as many studies have shown that 
    cardiometabolic health is improved to a higher extent in response to a combined diet and exercise programs compared to either intervention alone.

<b id="titre6">Cardiac rehabilitation </b>
<p>
    Exercise is also an important therapeutic treatment for patients who have cardiovascular diseases. A systematic review of 63 studies found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. 
    Another study looked specifically in patients with atherosclerosis post-revascularization surgery. 
    <br>Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation.
     <br>A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an acute myocardial infarction for 1 year after a coronary intervention surgery. The patients who underwent the exercise rehabilitation program had increased ejection fraction (60.81 vs. 53% control group), increased exercise tolerance, and reduced cardiovascular risk factors 6 months after starting the exercise rehabilitation program. 
    <br> This improvement in cardiovascular health in patients with atherosclerosis or post-MI is likely the result of increased myocardial perfusion in response to exercise, however more research is required to fully understand these mechanisms.
